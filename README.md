GitHub-XMPP
===========

An extensible framework and application to post GitHub notifications to XMPP group rooms (or other locations).

I'll get around to working out licensing, put up some howtos, and that sort of thing - this is bare-bones just now because I want to get a whole bunch of functionality up and running first.
